<h3>The Complete Guide to Prompt Artisan</h3>
<p>Welcome! This tool has been redesigned to be your intelligent assistant in prompt creation. It will help you turn a simple idea into an artistic and technically rich description that the neural network will understand.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Part 1: Quick Start and Interface</h3>
<h4>How to Enter Tags (The Main Rule)</h4>
<p>Separate your tags with a <strong>comma</strong>. The application will automatically trim extra spaces. For example: <code>1girl, long hair, blue eyes</code>.</p>
<h4>Managing Tag Weights (‚ñ≤ / ‚ñº)</h4>
<p>This is a key feature for controlling emphasis. Place your cursor <strong>right after</strong> the desired tag (or select it) and use the buttons to increase (<code>(tag:1.1)</code>) or decrease (<code>(tag:0.9)</code>) its impact.</p>
<h4>Automatic Quality Tags</h4>
<p>The <strong>"Add quality tags"</strong> option is enabled by default and automatically adds proven tags (<code>masterpiece, best quality...</code>) to the beginning of your prompt for maximum results. It is recommended to always keep this enabled.</p>
<h4>Contextual Help (i)</h4>
<p>Next to each section header, you will find an <strong>(i)</strong> icon. Hover over it to get a brief tip on what kind of information is best to enter in that field.</p>
<h4>Preset Management: Import & Export</h4>
<p>You manage your presets using <code>.json</code> files. Save successful combinations to the session, then export them to a file for permanent storage and sharing.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Part 2: From Idea to Masterpiece: The New Workflow</h3>
<p>The new interface is built around the natural creative process. Think in concepts, not just tags.</p>
<h4>Step 1: üé® Image Style ‚Äî The Foundation</h4>
<p>This is the most important field. Here, you decide what the final image will look like. Is it a <strong>photograph</strong>, a <strong>painting</strong>, <strong>anime</strong>, or something else?
<ul>
    <li><strong>Photography:</strong> <code>photograph, photorealistic, polaroid photo</code></li>
    <li><strong>Painting:</strong> <code>oil painting, watercolor, sketch</code></li>
    <li><strong>Anime:</strong> <code>anime style, key visual, manga</code></li>
    <li><strong>3D:</strong> <code>3d render, octane render, unreal engine</code></li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Step 2: üë§ Subject & Character ‚Äî The Protagonist</h4>
<p>In this block, we describe <strong>WHO</strong> or <strong>WHAT</strong> is the main focus of the scene.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Core & Action:</strong> The key information. <code>1girl, sitting on a throne</code>, <code>a dragon breathing fire</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Appearance & Details:</strong> Describe facial features, hair, and build. <code>long silver hair, green eyes, muscular build</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Clothing & Gear:</strong> What they wear and what they hold. <code>wearing intricate golden armor, holding a glowing sword</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 3: üèûÔ∏è Scene & Composition ‚Äî The World Around</h4>
<p>Here, we create the environment and define how the viewer will see the scene.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Location & Environment:</strong> Where does it all happen? <code>in a dark fantasy castle, on a neon-lit street at night</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Lighting & Atmosphere:</strong> The most powerful tool for creating a mood.</li>
    <li><strong>Camera & Angle:</strong> How the scene is "photographed."</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Part 3: Professional Tools</h3>
<h4>Using the Tag Browser (üìñ)</h4>
<p>For technical fields like "Lighting" and "Camera," a special tool is available: the <strong>Tag Browser</strong>. Click the <code>üìñ</code> icon to open it.</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Select a subcategory</strong> on the left (e.g., "Shot Type" or "Light Source").</li>
    <li><strong>Use the search bar</strong> for quick filtering.</li>
    <li><strong>Click on tags</strong> on the right to select one or more (multi-select).</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Add Selected"</strong> to add them to the text field.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The Browser is the best way to discover new, powerful tags and understand how they work.</p>
<h4>Tag Order Matters!</h4>
<p>The neural network pays more attention to the first tags. A professional prompt is structured like this:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Quality:</strong> <code>masterpiece, best quality...</code> (The app does this for you!)</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Parameters:</strong> Light and camera. <code>cinematic lighting, full body shot...</code></li>
    <li><strong>Style:</strong> <code>concept art, by greg rutkowski...</code></li>
    <li><strong>Main Subject & Description:</strong> <code>1girl, long hair, in a forest...</code></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Experiment! You now have all the knowledge needed to create true masterpieces.</strong></p>
